# Machine Learning Model Showcase

This GitHub repository serves as a showcase of my ability to build complex machine learning models for predictive modeling using libraries like TensorFlow and the Keras Subclassing API and pushing them into production using APIs and Docker Containerization. It demonstrates my proficiency in implementing advanced techniques such as callbacks like TensorBoard, early stopping, and model checkpoints.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **data**: Contains the processed and raw data used for training and evaluation.
- **models**: Includes directories for different models trained using the Keras Subclassing API.
- **notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks showcasing data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **src**: Contains the source code for the predictive model API using Django Rest Framework.
- **src_fastAPI_deprecated**: Contains the source code for the predictive model API using FastAPI.
- **training/logs**: Contains logs and information related to model training, including TensorBoard logs.

## Getting Started

To get started with the showcase, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src` directory.
3. Run `docker-compose up` to build and run the Docker containers.

## Usage

Once the Docker containers are up and running, you can access the machine learning model showcase via the provided API. The API endpoints can be accessed using the following URLs:

- Endpoint 1: `v1/api/perf` - Provides predictions using Final Model.

Feel free to explore the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for a more detailed understanding of the data exploration, model training, and evaluation processes.

## Dependencies

The showcase project requires the following dependencies:

- Docker Engine

Ensure that these dependencies are installed before running the project.
